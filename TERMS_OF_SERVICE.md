These Terms of Service are a legal agreement between Team Stable and you, the user. By using our service (i.e. adding our Discrod bot) you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted to be bound by these terms. If you under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you need to have your legal guardian review and agree to these terms in order to use our Service.

We reserve the right to update these terms at any point in time, to add, modify or remove legal requirements. If the aforementioned changes affect your usage of Team Stable Products, we will notify you at least seven days prior to those changes taking effect. Unless stated otherwise, continuing to use the service after modifications to the terms will display your agreement and acceptance to those changes.

# Discord Bot

Team Stable cannot be held responsible to any harm done to your Discord Server. Use the bot at your own risk and make sure to give minimal permissions in order to reduce potential risks.
